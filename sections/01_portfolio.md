A significant part of my current portfolio involves work revolving around the code that powers sites.  I am able to develop quick and refined solutions to code development needs. I also have design experience and am able to offer design solutions as part of any package of work required by clients.  Currently the majority of my work revolves around supporting the development and maintainance of currently existing sites for renowned agencies however I have expereince of developing from scratch and plan to branch out in to more direct client based work as opportunities arise. I am constantly seeking to refine my skills in this area and broaden my client base.

Below are some examples of recent projects in both a professional and personal capacity to give you a taster of my skills and experience. 

Professional Work
=================

ABRSM
-----

As part of the further development of the recently relaunched ABRSM site, I was required to develop an HTML5 and JavaScrip replacement for Flash based slideshows on the site. My experience in the use of multiple languages means that I was able to use JQuery to replicate the behaviour of the original slideshow with a more smooth and clean solution. 



Music Medals
------------

As part of the launch of the Music Medals site, ABRSM required a site that allowed public browsing of a vast database of pieces of sheet music publications.  The database was to be used to help identify pieces suited to a particular skill level, group size and intrument.

I created a small CMS and back-end data entry tool to enable employees to input data quickly and efficiently, and a lightning fast bespoke search which fulfilled all the goals of the project.

Further along in the development of the project I was able to provide the support needed so that the agency could give the site a complete re-design, transitioning smoothly to the new branding without any issues.


CBSO
----

CBSO was one of the original clients of an agency I have worked closely with over a number of years, and as such the site has undergone a huge journey of developments, improvements and client needs in the time I have been working with it. As part of my support for this client I had to learn to work with and extend a custom framework that was used for the original site, which I did effectively and thus can update and add features  quickly.


Cascade Style
-------------

This project required a solution to integrate the Wordpress WooCommerce plugin in to  a pre-existing theme that did not support the plugin.  This allowed the client to maintain the key features of their design and branding whilst adapting to the demands of their business.  The timeframe for the project was very tight and is a good demonstration of my ability to find solutions for clients quickly and effceiently when constrained by time and budget.

Bloomsbury
----------

This exciting project involved working as part of a team to develop an iPad application.  The app was JavaScrip base and provided a simple but attractively designed interface that enabled the user to browse play scripts in a dynamic manner - being able to highlight, cross reference, annotate and access notations for scripts.  I am happy to work collaboratively on projects and find the development of applications exciting and challenging. 

McDoogle's Monsters
-------------------

As part of the development of this project I was given an initial design outline and worked to develop an HTML template that mirrored the conceptial design.  An additional part of this project was developing the integration of the template with a Django based Content Management System. 


Non-Profit Projects
===================

Festival of Dangerous Ideas
---------------------------

For this project, I was asked by a campaigning group to take their original poster design concept and translate it in to a website with custom-coded vertical parallax scrolling and a responsive design which still retained the key features of the original conecpt art. 


Counterfire's Citizen Journalism Flyer
--------------------------------------

As part of Counterfire's upcoming workshop on Citizen Journalism, I was asked to develop a design concept that reflected the aims of the workshop and was both simple and yet eyecatching.  Using the newspaper style layout seemed appropriate to the theme of the workshop whilst retaining a clear style that allows easy scanning of the text.
