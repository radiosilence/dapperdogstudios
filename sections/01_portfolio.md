A lot of the work I currently do revolves around the code that powers sites as opposed the designs that the user sees. I do offer design services however, and will try to include any examples of this. Also, due to the nature of my work I the vast majority of my experience is working with existing sites as opposed to creating new ones -- not that I cannot do that, I just generally work with agencies as opposed to directly working with clients, however I am moving towards this area as I develop skills that would allow me to support customers as well as they deserve.

Following are examples of sites I have worked on professionally, and also a few examples of personal projects or work I have done for free.

Professional Work
=================

ABRSM
-----

When the new ABRSM site launched, the slideshow at the top of the page originally used Flash, and I was contracted to replace this quickly with a version that used HTML5 and JavaScript. I was able to replicate the behaviour of the original Flash slideshow and create a version that worked more smoothly and cleanly than the original using custom JQuery.


Music Medals
------------

When ABRSM wanted a site to launch their Music Medals scheme, a site was needed that allowed users to browse and search a large database of publications to find out which were suitable for their instrument, group size, or skill level.

I created a small CMS and back-end data entry tool to enable employees to input data quickly and efficiently, and a lightning fast bespoke search which fulfilled all the goals of the project.

Several years later, I was able to provide the support needed so that the agency could give the site a complete re-design and transition smoothly to the new branding without any issues.


CBSO
----

CBSO was one of the original clients of an agency I work with, and as such the site has undergone a huge amount of improvements and upgrades in the last ten or so years. I had to learn to work with and extend a custom framework that was used for the original site, which I did and thus can update and add features fairly quickly.


Cascade Style
-------------

For this project I worked on integrating Wordpress WooCommerce plugin into a theme that did not support it, the project was done withing two weaeks as I am awesome and fast


Bloomsbury
----------

I was contracted to produce a JavaScript protype of an iPad application for their play browser.


McDoogle's Monsters
-------------------

For this project I was given the initial design and turned it into the HTML template, and worked on integrating it with a Django based CMS.


Non-Profit Projects
===================

Festival of Dangerous Ideas
---------------------------

For this project I took a poster design and translated it into a website with custom-coded vertical parallax scrolling and a responsive design.


Counterfire's Citizen Journalism Flyer
--------------------------------------

I designed and produced this flyer to look like a newspaper because it is about journalism.
